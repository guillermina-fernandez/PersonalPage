This is my personal page, created with Django. 

I created this project as a more interactive way of showing my CV and other projects I've been working on. 
Also, I added a few "games" where I apply my programming skills: 
* Share the bill: You can calculate how much is everyone's share of a bill, including tips. 
* Secret Santa: You can add as many people as you want and it will randomly assign everybody another person to give a gift. 
* Keep score: You can create teams and keep score by adding or subtracting points. It also has a stopwatch to track time. 
* Vote City: A very simple poll about favourite cities.
